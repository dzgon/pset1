This is a warning.

README.md contains some components to the solution to cs50's pset1 mario problem.

I recommend not opening README.md unless you have already solved the problem yourself,
or you are not interested in solving it.

README.md contains background information, I will repeat it here so that you may view it
without viewing the solution to the mario problem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

background:

I am currently enrolled in cs50 ap. This summer I had discovered cs50 and enrolled my self in that course without knowing that 
my AP CS Principles course used a version of Harvards cs50 course.

Basically I got up to pset 1 (the mario one) but I never actually completed it.

This is my solution that I wrote in CS50 IDE, which I then copied and pasted it into the text editor ATOM and uploaded to 
github using gitbash.

That would explain why it looked like all of it was done at once or why it may look like I just stole someone elses work.

I completed the work myself, and you guys are free to check its validity in anyway.
